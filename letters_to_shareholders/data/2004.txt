 Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companie s to value the equity securities they hold at market 
rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was prev iously the requirement.  In this table, Berkshire’s results 
through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rule s.  In all other respects, the results are calculated using 
the numbers originally reported. 
The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax  whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax .  If a corporation such as Berkshire 
were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appr opriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 
in years when that index showed a pos itive return, but would have exceeded the S&P in years when the index showed a 
negative return.  Over the years, the tax costs woul d have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.    
 
BER KSHIR E HATHAWAY  INC. 
 
 
To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hath away Inc. : 
 
 Our gain in net worth du ring 2004 was $8.3 billion, which increased  the per-share book  value of 
both our Class A and Class B stock by 10.5%.  Over the last 40 y ears (that is, since present  manage ment 
took over) book value has grown from  $19 t o $55,824, a rate of 21.9% c ompounded annually.* 
 
 It’s pe r-share intrinsic val ue that cou nts, however, not book value.  Here , the news is good: 
Between  196 4 and 200 4, Berk shire m orphed  from a struggling north ern textile b usiness who se intrinsic 
value was less th an book into a diversified en terprise w orth fa r more than book.  Our 40-year gain in 
intrinsic value has there fore s omewhat  exceeded our 21.9% gain in book.  (For an e xplanation of intrinsic  
value and the econ omic pri nciples that guide C harlie Munger, my part ner and B erkshire’s vi ce-chai rman, 
and me in runnin g Berkshire, please r ead our Ow ner’s Manu al, beginning on page 73.) 
 
 Desp ite their sh ortco mings, yearly calcu lations of book va lue are  useful at Berk shire as a sligh tly 
understated gauge f or measuri ng the long-term  rate o f increase in  our intrinsic v alue.  Th e calcu lations are 
less rel evant, however, than they once we re in rating any single year’s performance v ersus the S&P 500 
index (a c omparison we display on the faci ng page).  Our equity holdings (including convertible preferreds) 
have fallen considerably as a p ercentage of our net wo rth, from an average of 114% in  the 1980s, f or 
exam ple, to less than 50% i n recent years .  There fore, yea rly movem ents in the stoc k market now affe ct a 
much smaller p ortion  of ou r net worth  than was once the case, a fact th at will n ormally cau se us to  
underperform in years when stocks rise substantially and overperform in years when they fall. 
 
 Howe ver the yearly co mparisons work out, Berk shire’s long-term  perform ance vers us the S&P 
remains all-important.  Our shareholders can buy the S&P through an index fund at very low cost.  Unless 
we ach ieve gains in per-share intrinsic value in the future that ou tdo the S&P, C harlie and  I will b e adding 
nothing to wh at yo u can accom plish on your ow n. 
 
 Last year , Berk shire’s boo k-value gain of  10.5% f ell sho rt of the index ’s 10.9% return.  Our 
lackluster performance was n ot due t o any stumbles by  the CEOs o f our operating businesses:  As al ways, 
they pulled more than their share of th e load .  My m essage to them  is simple: Ru n your business as if it 
were t he only asset yo ur fam ily will o wn over the next hundred years.  Almost invariably they do  just that 
and, a fter ta king ca re of the needs of their business , send excess cash to Omaha for m e to de ploy. 
 
 I didn’t do that job very well last year.  My hope wa s to make several multi-billion dollar 
acquisition s that wou ld add  new and  significan t stream s of earn ings to the many we alread y have.  But I 
struck out.  Additionally, I found very  few attractiv e securities to  buy.  Berkshire therefo re end ed the year 
with $43 billion of cash equivalen ts, not a happy position.  Charlie and  I will work to  translate so me of th is 
hoard int o more interesting assets duri ng 2005, t hough we can’t prom ise success. 
 
 In one res pect, 2004 was a rem arkable year fo r the stoc k market, a fact burie d in the maze of  
numbers on  page 2.  If yo u examine the 35 years sin ce th e 1960s end ed, yo u will find th at an  investor’s 
return, including dividends, from owni ng the S&P has a veraged 11.2% annua lly (well above what we  
expect future returns to be). Bu t if yo u look for years wi th returns any where close t o that 11.2% – say, 
between  8% an d 14% – you will fin d only one before 2004 .  In other words, last year ’s “normal” return is 
anything but. 
 
 
  
 * All fi gures used in t his report ap ply to Berkshi re’s A shares, the successor to the  only stock that  
the company had  outstan ding before 1996.  The B shares hav e an econ omic interest equal to  1/30th that of 
the A. 
 3  Over the 35 ye ars, American bus iness has delivered terrific res ults.  It should therefore have  been 
easy fo r inv estors to earn  juicy retu rns: All th ey h ad to do was piggyback Corporate Am erica in a 
diversified, low-expense way.  An i ndex fund that they neve r touche d would have done the job.  Instead 
many invest ors have had experiences ranging from mediocre to disastrous. 
 
 There  have been three primary causes:  first, high c osts, usually because inves tors t raded 
excessi vely or spent far too much on invest ment management; second, portfolio deci sions based on tips and  
fads rather than on thou ghtful, q uantified  evaluation of businesses; and  third, a star t-and-stop approach to 
the market marked by untimely en tries (after an adva nce has been long underway ) and exits (a fter periods 
of stagnation or decl ine).  Investors s hould remember that exci tement and expe nses a re their enemies.  And 
if they in sist o n tryin g to time th eir participatio n in equities, th ey sho uld try to  be fearfu l when others are 
greedy and greedy only when others are fea rful. 
 
Sector Results  
 
 As managers, C harlie and I want  to give our owners the financi al information and c ommentary we 
would wish t o receive if our roles were re verse d.  To do this with both clar ity and reasona ble bre vity 
becom es more di fficult as B erkshire’s scope widens.  Some of o ur businesses have vast ly different 
econom ic characteristics from others, which means that our consolidated state ments, with  their jumble of 
figures, make usef ul analysis almost impossible. 
 
 On th e following pages, therefore, we will present some balance sheet and earn ings figures from 
our four major categories of businesses  along with commentary ab out each .  We particularly wan t you to 
understand  the li mited circum stances un der which we will u se debt, given that we ty pically sh un it.  We 
will n ot, howev er, in undate yo u with data that has no real value in estimatin g Berk shire’s in trinsic v alue.  
Doing so would tend to obfuscate the facts  that count. 
 
Regulated Uti lity Businesses  
 
  We ha ve an 80.5% (fully diluted) interest in MidAm erican Ene rgy Holdings, which owns a wide 
variety o f utility o peration s.  The larg est of these are (1 ) Yorkshire Electricity  and Northern Electric, wh ose 
3.7 million electric cu stomers m ake it t he third larg est d istribu tor of electricity in  the U.K.; (2) 
MidAm erican Energy, whic h serves 698,000 electric customers,  primarily in Iowa; an d (3) Kern  River and 
Northern Natural pipelines, which carry 7.9% of the natural gas c onsum ed in the U.S. 
 
  The remaining 19 .5% of MidAmerican i s owned by three partners of ours:  Dave  Sokol and Greg 
Abel, th e brillian t managers of these bu sinesses, an d Walter Sco tt, a long-time frien d of m ine who 
introdu ced m e to the company.  Becau se MidAmerican  is sub ject to the Pub lic Utility Ho lding Com pany 
Act (“PUHCA”), Berk shire’s voting interest is limited to 9.9%.  Vo ting control rests with Walter. 
 
  Our limited  voting interest forces us to acco unt for Mi dAm erican in an  abbreviated manner.   
Instead  of our fully in corporating the company’s asse ts, liab ilities, rev enues an d expenses in to Berk shire’s 
statements, we m ake one-line en tries only in  both our balance sheet and income account.  It’s lik ely, 
though, t hat PUHC A will someday – perhaps soon – be repeale d or that accoun ting rules will cha nge.  
Berks hire’s consoli dated figures woul d then in corporate all o f Mid American , including the substan tial d ebt 
it utilizes (th ough this debt is not now, nor will it ev er be, an obligation of Berk shire). 
 
  At yearend , $1.47 8 billion of Mid American ’s junior debt was payable to Berk shire.  This debt has 
allowed acquisitions t o be finance d without our partners nee ding t o increase  their already s ubstantial 
investments in MidAmerican .  By ch arging 11% interest, B erkshire is co mpensated  fairly for putting up the 
funds needed for purchases, wh ile ou r partners are sp ared dilution of th eir equ ity in terests.  Becau se 
MidAmerican  mad e no large acquisition s last year, it p aid down $100 million of what it owes us. 
 
 
 
 4   MidAmerican  also  own s a significan t non-utility b usiness, Ho meServices o f America, th e second  
largest real est ate broker in the country.  Unlike our utility o perations, this bu siness is h ighly cyclica l, but 
nevertheless on e we view enthusiastically.  We have an exceptional manager, Ron  Peltier, wh o through 
both his acq uisition and operatio nal skills is b uilding a brokerag e powerh ouse. 
 
  HomeServices p articip ated in $59.8 billion of tran sactions in  2004, a gain of $11.2 billio n from 
2003.  About 24% of the increase cam e from six acqui sitions m ade during the year.  Through our 17 
brokerage firms –  all o f which retain  their lo cal id entities –  we em ploy more th an 18,000 brok ers in 1 8 
states.  Hom eServices is alm ost certa in to grow substantially in the ne xt decade as we c ontinue t o acquire  
leading localized  operation s. 
 
  Last year Mid American  wrote off a m ajor investment in a zin c reco very p roject th at was in itiated  
in 1998 and became operation al in 2002.  Larg e quantities o f zinc are presen t in the brin e pro duced by o ur 
California ge otherm al operat ions, and we believed we c ould profitably extract the metal.  For m any 
months, it appeared that commercially- viable recov eries were i mminent.  Bu t in mining, just as in  oil 
exploration, prospects have a way  of “teasing” their developers, and every time one problem was s olved, 
another popped up.  In September, we t hrew in the towel. 
 
  Our fail ure here illu strates th e importance of a gu ideline – stay with  simp le propositions – that we 
usually ap ply in investments as well as operatio ns.  If only on e variable is k ey to a decision , and the 
variable has a 90% chance of going your way, the chan ce for a successful  outcom e is obviously 90%.  But 
if ten indepe ndent va riables need to brea k favorably for a successful result, and each has a 90% proba bility 
of success , the likelihood of having a winner is only 35 %.  In our zinc vent ure, we solve d most of the  
problem s.  But one prove d intractable, and t hat was one too many.  Since a chai n is no stronger than its 
weake st link, it makes sense t o look for – if you’ll excuse an oxymoron – mono-l inked chains. 
 
  A breakdown of MidA merican’s results fo llows.  In 2004, th e “other” categ ory includes a $7 2.2 
million profit from  sale  of an Enro n recei vable that was thrown in wh en we purc hased Northern Na tural 
two years ea rlier.  Walter, Dave an d I, as nat ives o f Omaha, view th is un anticip ated gain as war rep aration s 
– partial co mpensation  for the lo ss ou r city su ffered  in 1986 when  Ken Lay moved Northern to Housto n, 
after promising to leav e the com pany here.  (F or details, see Ber kshire’s 2002 annu al report.)

 5 Insur ance 
 
 Since B erkshire purchased National Indem nity (“NIC O”) in 1967, property-casual ty insurance has 
been our core business a nd the propellant of our growth.  Insurance has provided a fountain of funds with 
which we’v e acq uired th e secu rities and  businesses th at now give us an ever-wi dening variety of earnin gs 
stream s.  So  in this sectio n, I will b e spending a little ti me telling you how we got where we are. 
 
 The s ource of our insurance funds is “float,” which is money  that does n’t belong to us but that we 
temporarily hold.  Most of our fl oat arises because (1) pre miums are pa id upfront though  the servic e we  
provide – insurance protection – i s delivered over a pe riod that usual ly cove rs a y ear and; (2) loss events 
that occur toda y do not always resu lt in our immediately p aying claim s, because it sometim es takes many 
years for lo sses to  be repo rted (asb estos lo sses wou ld be an example), negotiated  and settled .  Th e $20 
million of float that came with our 1967 purchase has n ow increase d – bot h by way of internal growth and 
acquisition s – to $46.1 billion. 
 
 Float is wonderful – if it doesn’t come at a high price.  Its co st is d etermined by underwritin g 
results, m eaning how th e expen ses an d losses we will ultimatel y pay com pare with  the premiums we h ave 
receive d.  Whe n an underwriting profit is achieve d – as has been the case  at Berksh ire in about half of the  
38 years we have bee n in the insurance  business – float is better than free.  I n such years, we are act ually 
paid for holding other people’s m oney .  For m ost insurers, however, life has been far more di fficult: In 
aggre gate, the property-cas ualty industry al most invariabl y operates at  an underwriting loss .  Whe n that 
loss is large, float becomes expe nsive, sometimes devast atingly so. 
 
 Insurers have gene rally earned poor returns for a simple reas on: They  sell a com modity-like 
product.  Policy forms are st andard, and the product is available from many suppliers, some of whom are 
mutual co mpanies (“o wned” by policyho lders rath er th an stockholders) with profit g oals that are li mited.  
Moreover, most insureds don’t care f rom whom they buy.  Customers by the millions say “I need some 
Gillette b lades” o r “I’ll h ave a Coke” bu t we wait in  vain for “I’d  like a Natio nal Indemnity policy, p lease.”   
Consequently, price co mpetition in insurance is u sually fierce.  Th ink airline seats. 
 
 So, you  may ask , how  do Berkshire’s insuran ce operations overc ome the dism al economics of t he 
industry an d achieve some measu re of enduring competitiv e advantage?  We’v e attack ed th at problem in 
several ways.  Let’s lo ok first at N ICO’s stra tegy. 
 
 When we purchased the company – a sp ecialist in  comme rcial au to and general liab ility insurance 
– it did not appear t o have  any attributes that would overcome the industry’s chronic troubles.  It was not 
well-known, had no informational advantage (the com pany has never had an actuary), was not a low-cost 
operator, and sold through genera l age nts, a method m any people thou ght outdate d.  Neve rtheless, for 
almost all o f the past 38 years, NICO h as been a star performer.  Ind eed, had we not made this acq uisition, 
Berk shire would be lucky to be wo rth half of what it is tod ay. 
 
 What  we’ve had going for us is a managerial mindset  that most insurers find impossi ble to 
replicate.  Tak e a look at  the facing page.  Can you imagine any public com pany e mbracing a busi ness 
model that woul d lead t o the decl ine in revenue that we expe rienced from  198 6 through 1999?  That 
colossal slide , it shoul d be e mphasized, di d not oc cur b ecause busi ness was unobtaina ble.  Many billions o f 
premium dollars were readily av ailab le to NICO had we only been willing to cut prices.  B ut we i nstead 
consisten tly priced to make a profit, no t to match  our most optimistic co mpetitor.  We never left cu stomers 
– but they left us. 
 
 Most Am erican  businesses harbo r an “institutional imperative” th at rej ects ex tended decreases in 
volume.  What  CEO want s to repo rt to his share holders that not only did business co ntract last year but  that 
it will  continue to drop ?  In insu rance, the  urge to keep writing busi ness is also intensified because the 
consequences of foolishly-priced p olicies may not bec ome appare nt for some time.  If a n insurer is 
optimistic in its reserv ing, rep orted earn ings will b e overstated , and years m ay pass before true loss co sts 
are re veale d (a form  of self-de ception that nearly destroyed GEICO in the early 19 70s).

*It takes a l ong time to learn the tr ue profitability of any given year.  First, m any clai ms are receive d after 
the end of t he year, an d we must esti mate how many of these t here will b e and what they will co st.  (In 
insurance jargon, these claim s are te rmed IB NR – incurred but not reported.)  Sec ond, claims often take 
years, or eve n decade s, to settle, which m eans there  can be  many su rprises  along t he way. 
 
For these reason s, the results in  this column simply rep resent o ur best esti mate at the end of  2004 as to  how

 7  Finally, there is a fear factor at work , in that a shri nking business us ually leads t o layoffs.  To  
avoid pink slips, em ployees will ration alize in adequate pricin g, tellin g themselves th at poorly-priced 
business m ust be tolerated in order to keep t he organization intact and t he distribution system happy .  If t his 
course isn’t follo wed, th ese e mployees will arg ue, the company will  not particip ate in  the reco very th at 
they inva riably  feel is just around t he corner. 
 
 To com bat employees’ nat ural tendency  to save t heir own ski ns, we ha ve al ways prom ised 
NICO’s workforce that no one will be fired because  of declining volu me, howeve r severe the c ontrac tion.  
(This is  not Donald T rump’s sort of place.)  NICO is not la bor-i ntensi ve, and, as t he tabl e sugge sts, ca n live 
with excess overhead.  It can ’t live, howev er, with  underpriced business a nd the breakdown in underwriting 
discipline t hat accom panies it.  An in suranc e orga nization that doesn’t ca re deeply a bout unde rwriting at a 
profit this year is un likely to  care next year ei ther. 
 
 Naturally, a business th at fo llows a n o-layo ff policy m ust be especia lly careful  to avoid 
overstaffing  when times are go od.  Th irty years ag o Tom Murphy, then CEO of Cap Cities, d rove this point 
home to me with a hypothetical tale about  an em ployee who asked his boss for permission to hire an  
assistant.  The employee assu med that adding $20,000 to the annual payroll would be inconsequential.  But 
his boss told him the proposal should be evaluated as a $3  million decision, given that an  additional person 
would probably cost  at least that amount over his lifetime, fact oring in raises, be nefits and other expenses 
(more pe ople, more toilet paper).  And unless the com pany fell on very hard times, the em ployee added 
would be unlikely to be dismissed,  however marginal his contribution to the business. 
 
 It takes re al fortitude – em bedde d deep within a company’s cul ture – to operate as NICO does.  
Anyone exam ining the  table can sca n the years from  1986 to 1999 quickly.  Bu t living day after day with 
dwindling volume – while co mpetitors are b oasting of growth and reaping Wall Street ’s app lause –  is an 
experience few managers can tolerate.  N ICO, how ever, has had four CEO s since its f ormatio n in 1940 an d 
none have bent.  (It should be noted that only one of the four graduated from college.  Our experience tells 
us that ex traord inary bu siness ab ility is largely in nate.) 
 
 The cu rrent manage rial star – m ake that supe rstar – at NIC O is Do n Wu rster (y es, he’s “the  
graduate”), who has bee n running things since 1989.  His slugging perce ntage is right up there with Barry 
Bonds’ because, like Barry, Don will accept a walk rathe r than swing at a bad pitch.  Don has now am assed 
$950 million of float at NICO that over tim e is al most certain  to be proved the negative-cost kind.  Becau se 
insuran ce prices are fallin g, Don’s volume will so on decline very significantly an d, as it does, Charlie an d I 
will ap plaud him ever more lou dly.

 Another way to prosper in a commodity-type business is to be the low-cost operator.  Among a uto 
insurers op eratin g on a broad scale, GEICO holds that ch erish ed title.  For NIC O, as we have seen , an ebb-
and-flow business m odel makes se nse.  But a company holding a low-cost advantage m ust pursue an 
unrelenting foot-to-the-floor strategy.  And that’s just what we do at GEICO. 
 
 A ce ntury ago, when aut os first appeare d, the property- casualty in dustry operated as a cartel.  Th e 
major com panies, most of wh ich were base d in the Nort heast, established “bureau” rat es and t hat was it.  
No one cut prices to  attract b usiness.  In stead , insurers co mpeted for str ong, well-re garded agents, a foc us 
that produced high commissi ons for agents and high prices for consumers. 
 
 In 1922, State Farm  was fo rmed by Geo rge Mech erle, a farmer fro m Mern a, Illino is, who  aimed to 
take adva ntage of t he pri cing umbrella maintained by the high-cost giants of t he industry.  St ate Farm  
employed a “cap tive” ag ency force, a system k eeping its acq uisition  costs lo wer t han those incurred  by the 
bureau insurers (whose “i ndependent” agent s successfully played off on e com pany against anot her).  W ith 
its low-c ost structure, State Farm  event ually capture d about 25% of the personal lines (a uto and 
homeowners) busi ness, far o utdistancing its once -mighty com petitors.  Allstate, formed in 1931, put  a 
similar distribution system  into place a nd soon becam e the runner-up in personal lines t o State Farm .  
Capitalis m had wo rked its m agic, an d these low-co st op eratio ns looked unsto ppable. 
 
 8  But a man nam ed Leo G oodwin had an i dea for an even more efficient auto ins urer and, with a 
skimpy $200,000, started GEICO in 1936.  Goodwin’s plan was t o eliminate the agent entirely and to deal  
instead di rectly with the auto ow ner.  Why, he as ked him self, shoul d there be any unnecessary  and  
expe nsive links in the distribution mechani sm when t he produ ct, aut o insura nce, was both m andatory and 
costly.  Purc hasers o f business insurance , he reas oned, might well require professional advi ce, b ut most 
consum ers kne w what t hey ne eded in a n auto policy.  Th at was a po werful insight. 
 
 Originally, GEICO m ailed its low-cost m essage to a limited audience of government employees.  
Later, it wi dened its horizon s and  shifted its m arketing emphasis to  the phone, wo rking inquiries th at ca me 
from broa dcast  and print advertising.  And today the Internet is com ing on strong. 
 
 Betw een 1936 and 1975, GEICO grew from a standing sta rt to a 4% m arket sha re, becoming the  
country’s fo urth larg est au to insurer.  Duri ng most of this period, th e company was su perbly managed, 
achieving both excel lent volume gains and high profits.  It looke d unstoppable.  B ut after my friend and  
hero Lorimer Davi dson retired as C EO in 1970, his suc cesso rs soon made a h uge mistake by  under-
reserv ing for lo sses.  This produced faulty co st inform ation, which in turn produced inadequate pricing .  By 
1976, GEICO was on  the brink of failure. 
 
 Jack Byrne the n joine d GEICO as CE O and, alm ost single-handedly, save d the company by heroic 
efforts t hat inc luded major price incr eases .  Though GEICO’s survi val required these, po licyh olders fled 
the com pany, and by 1980 its market share  had fal len to 1.8%.  Subsequently, the company embarked on 
some unwise diversificatio n moves.  This sh ift of emphasis away from  its extraordinary c ore business 
stunted GEIC O’s growth, and by 1993 its market share had grown only fract ionally, to 1.9%.  Then Tony 
Nicely took c harge. 
 
 And what a differen ce th at’s made: In 2005 GEIC O will p robably secu re a 6% market sh are.  
Better yet, To ny has matched growth  with p rofitab ility.  Indeed, GEIC O delivers all of its co nstituen ts 
major benefits: In  2004 its cu stomers sav ed $1 billion or so compared to what they wou ld otherwise have 
paid for coverage, its associ ates earn ed a $191 million profit-sharing bonus that averaged 24.3% of salary, 
and its own er – that’s us – enjo yed excellen t financial returns. 
 
 There’s more good news.  When Jack Byr ne was re scuing the com pany in 1976, New Je rsey 
refused to grant him the rat es he neede d to operate profitably.  He t herefore promptly – an d properly – 
withdre w from  the state.  Subseq uently, GEICO avo ided both New Jersey an d Massachu setts, recogn izing 
them as two  jurisdictions in which insurers were  destine d to struggle. 
 
 In 2003, however, New Je rsey took a new l ook at its chro nic aut o-insurance pr oblems and e nacted 
legislation that would curb fraud and allow insurers a fai r playing fi eld.  Eve n so, one might have e xpected 
the state’s bureaucracy t o make change slow and di fficult. 
 
 But just the opposite occurred.  Holly Bakke, the New Jersey insurance commissioner,  who would 
be a success i n any line of work, was determined to turn the law’s in tent into reality.  With her staff’s 
cooperatio n, GEICO iro ned out the details fo r re-en tering the state and was license d last August. Since  
then, we’v e receiv ed a respo nse fro m New Jersey  drivers that is m ultiples of m y expectatio ns. 
 
 We are n ow serving 140,000 policyholders – abo ut 4% of the Ne w Je rsey market – and sa ving 
them subst antial sum s (as we do drivers e verywhere).  Word-of-mouth recom mendations wi thin the state 
are causi ng inquiries to pour in.  And once we hea r from a New Jersey  pros pect, our closure rate – the 
percentage of policies issu ed to inquiries receiv ed – is far higher in th e state th an it is nationally. 
 
 We m ake no  claim, of co urse, that we can save every one money .  Som e com panies, using rating 
syste ms that are differen t from o urs, will o ffer certai n classes o f drivers a lower rate than  we do.  Bu t we 
believe GE ICO offers the lowest price m ore oft en than any other nationa l company that serves all segments 
of the public.  In a ddition, in m ost states, includi ng Ne w Jersey, Be rkshire share holders recei ve an 8% 
discount.  So gam ble fifteen minutes of y our t ime and go  to GEIC O.com – or cal l 800- 847-7536 – to see

products).

 Reinsu rance – insura nce sol d to othe r ins urers who wish to lay off p art of t he risks they have 
assumed – shou ld not be a commo dity product.  At bottom, any insurance po licy is si mply a pro mise, an d 
as ev eryon e knows, promises v ary eno rmously in their quality. 
 
 At th e prim ary in surance lev el, nevertheless, just who makes t he promise is often of m inor 
importance.  In personal-lines insurance , for exam ple, states levy assess ments on s olvent com panies to pay 
the po licyho lders of companies th at go  broke.  In the business-insurance fi eld, the sam e arrange ment 
applies to work ers’ compensatio n policies.  “Protected” policies of  these typ es acco unt f or about 60% of  
the property-casualty industry’s volume.  Prude ntly-run insurers are irritated  by the need to  subsidize po or 
or reck less m anagement elsewh ere, bu t that’s the way it is. 
 
 Other forms of busi ness insurance at  the primary level involve promises that  carry  greater risks for 
the ins ured.  Whe n Relianc e Ins urance a nd Home Insu rance we re run into the  ground, for e xample, their 
promises prov ed to be w orthless.  C onsequently, many holders o f their business policies (other than those 
cove ring workers’ compensat ion) suffered  painful losses. 
 
 The solvency risk  in primary policies, however, pales in compariso n to that lurking in reinsuran ce 
policies.  Whe n a rei nsurer goes broke, stag gering losses almost always strik e the primary companies it h as 
dealt with .  Th is risk  is far from minor: GEICO has suffered  tens of millio ns in losses fro m its care less 
selection of reinsurers in the e arly 1980s. 
 
 Were a tru e meg a-catastrop he to  occur in th e next decade or two – and that’s a real possib ility –  
some rein surers wou ld not survive.  Th e larg est in sured loss to  date is th e World Trad e Cen ter disaster,  
which cost the insurance indu stry an estimated  $35 billion .  Hurrican e Andrew co st insurers abou t $15.5 
billion in 1992 (th ough that loss wo uld be far h igher in today’s do llars).  Bo th events rocked the insuran ce 
and reinsurance wo rld.  But a $100 billion event, or even  a larg er catastrop he, rem ains a possibility if ei ther 
a particula rly severe ea rthqua ke or hurrica ne hits just  the wrong place.  Four si gnificant hurricanes struck 
Florida during 2004, cau sing an  aggreg ate of $25 billion or so in insured losses.  Two o f these – Charley  
and Ivan – could have done at least three times the dam age they did had they entered the U.S . not far from 
their actual landing points. 
 
 Many insurers regard a $100 billion industry loss as “u nthinkable” and  won’t ev en plan for it.  Bu t 
at Berkshi re, we are ful ly prepared.  Our share of t he loss would probably be 3% t o 5%, and ear nings from 
our i nvestm ents and other businesses woul d com fortably e xceed that cost.  Whe n “the day after”  arrives, 
Berk shire’s check s will clear. 
 
 Though the hurrican es hit us with  a $1 .25 billion loss, ou r reinsurance operations did well last 
year.  At Gene ral Re, Joe Bra ndon has re stored a long -admired culture of u nderwritin g discip line that, fo r a 
time, had l ost its way .  The excellent results he realized i n 2004 on current business, however, were offset 
by adve rse d evelopments from the years befo re he t ook the helm .  At  NIC O’s rei nsurance o peration, Ajit 
Jain continues to succes sfully underwrite huge risks that no other reinsurer is willing or a ble to ac cept.  
Ajit’s v alue to Berk shire is eno rmous.

 Berk shire’s float in creased  $1.9 billion in 2004, even though a few insu reds opted to commute 
(that is, unwind) certain reinsurance c ontracts.  We agree to such commutations o nly when we believe the 
econ omics are favorable to us (after giving due weight to what  we might earn in the future on the money 
we are returning). 
 
 To summarize, last year we were p aid more th an $1.5 billion to hold an av erage of about $45.2 
billion.  In 2005 pricin g will b e less attract ive than it has been.  Nevertheless, ab sent a mega-catastrop he, 
we have  a dece nt chance of achieving no-cost float again this year. 
 
Finance  and F inance Produc ts 
 
 Last year in  this sectio n we d iscussed a potpourri of activities.  In  this report, we’ll sk ip over 
several  that are now of lesser importance:  Berkadia is do wn to tag ends; Value Capital h as added other 
invest ors, negating o ur expectation that we wo uld nee d to consolidate its fin ancials in to ours; and th e 
trading operation that I run  continues to shri nk. 
 
• Both of Berk shire’s leasin g operation s rebo unded last year.  At CORT (office furniture), earnings  
remain inadeq uate, but are t rending upward.  XTRA disposed of its container and intermodal 
businesses in  order to concentrate on  trailer leasin g, long  its stro ng suit.  Ov erhead h as been 
reduced, asset u tilizatio n is u p and decent profits are now b eing achieved under Bill  Fran z, the 
company’s ne w CEO. 
 
• The wind -down of Gen Re Secu rities con tinues.  We decided  to exit this derivative operatio n three 
years ag o, but getting out is easier said th an done.  Tho ugh derivative instruments are purported t o 
be hi ghly liquid – an d though we hav e had the benefit of a beni gn m arket while liquidating ours – 
we still h ad 2,8 90 contracts outstanding at yearend , down from 23,218 at th e peak.  Like Hell, 
derivative trad ing is easy to en ter but difficult to  leave.  (Ot her similarities  come to mind as well.) 
 
Gen Re’s derivative contracts have  always been re quired to be marked to mark et, an d I believ e the 
company’s managem ent conscientiously tried to make rea listic “marks.”  The  market prices of 
derivatives, however, can  be v ery fuzzy in a world  in which settlemen t of a tran saction  is 
sometimes d ecades away and o ften involves multiple variables as well.  In  the interim  the marks 
influence t he manageri al and trading bonuses t hat are paid annually.  It’s s mall wonde r that 
phantom profits are often recorded. 
 
Investors should  und erstan d that in  all types of  financial institutions, rap id grow th sometimes 
masks m ajor u nderlying problems (and occasionally fraud).  The re al test of the earning power of 
a derivatives operation  is what it ach ieves after operating for an  extended  period in a no-growth 
mode.  Y ou only learn who has bee n swimming na ked when the tide goes out. 
 
• After 40  years, we’v e finally generated a little sy nergy at B erkshire: Clayto n Ho mes is do ing well 
and that’s in part due to its asso ciatio n with Berkshire.  The manufactured ho me industry 
 11 continues to reside in the intensive care unit of Corporate America, havi ng sold less than 135,000 
new ho mes last year, abou t the sam e as in  2003.  Volume in  these y ears was th e lowest since 
1962, and it was al so only abo ut 40% of  ann ual sales d uring the year s 1995-99.  That era, 
charact erized by irresponsible financing and naïve funders, was a  fool’s paradise for the industry.  
 
Because one major le nder after anot her has fle d the field, fi nancing continues t o bedevil 
manufact urers, retailers an d purchasers of manufact ured homes.  He re Berkshire’s support has 
proven valuable to Clayton.  We stand ready  to fund whatever makes sen se, an d last year  
Clayton’s m anagem ent found much that qualified. 
 
As we explained  in our 2003 r eport, we believe in using  borrowed money to  support profitable, 
interest-beari ng receiva bles.  At the be ginning of last year, we ha d borrowed  $2 billion to relend to 
Clayto n (at a one percentage-point markup) and by Janu ary 2005 the total was $7.35 billion.  M ost 
of the dollars added were borrowed by us on January 4, 2005, to finance a seaso ned portfolio that 
Clayton purc hased on December 30, 200 4 from  a bank e xiting t he business. 
 
We no w have two additional portfolio purchases in  the wo rks, totaling  about $1.6 billion, but it’s 
quite unlikely that we will secure others of a ny significa nce.  There fore, C layton’s recei vables (in 
which originations will roughly offset p ayoffs) will probab ly ho ver arou nd $9 billion for so me 
time and shou ld deliver steady earn ings.  This p attern will b e far differen t from that of the past, in  
whic h Clayton, like all major players in its i ndustry, “securitized ” its receivables , causing earni ngs 
to be fro nt-ended .  In th e last two years, th e securitizatio n mark et has dried up.  The limited  funds 
available today com e onl y at higher cost and with harsh terms.  Ha d Clayton rem ained 
independent in this period, it would have had mediocre ea rnings as  it struggled with financing. 
 
In April, Clayto n completed  the acq uisition of Oakwood Homes and is now th e industry’s larg est 
produce r and retailer of m anufact ured homes.  We l ove putting more asse ts in the han ds of Ke vin 
Clayton, the company’s CEO.  He is a prototype Berkshire manager.  Today , Clayton has 11,837 
employees, up from 7,136 when we purchased it, and Charlie and I are pleased t hat Berkshire has 
been usefu l in facilitatin g this growth. 
 
For sim plicity’s sak e, we include all of Clayto n’s earnings in this sector, t hough a sizabl e portion 
of these a re derived from areas ot her than consum er finance .

• In the building-products sector  and at Shaw, we’ve experie nced sta ggering cost inc reases for both raw-
materials and energy.  By Dece mber, for e xample, steel costs at MiTek (whose prim ary busi ness is 
connector s for roof trusses)  were running 100% over a year earlier.  And MiTek  uses 665  million 
pounds of steel every  year.  Nevertheless, the company continues to be an outstanding performer.  
 13 Since we purchased MiTek  in 2001, Gene Toombs, its CEO, h as made some brilliant “bo lt-on ” 
acquisition s and is on his way  to creatin g a mini-Berk shire. 
 
 Shaw fielded a barrage of price increases in its main fiber materials during the year, a hit that added 
more th an $300 million to its co sts.  (Wh en you  walk on ca rpet y ou are, in effect, stepping on 
processe d oil.)  Though we fo llowed these hi kes in costs with price increa ses of  our own, there was an 
inevitable lag.  There fore, margins narrowed as the year pr ogresse d and remain under pressure today.  
Despi te these roadblocks, S haw, l ed by Bob Sha w and Julian Saul , earn ed an o utstanding 25.6% on 
tangible equity in 2004.   The com pany is a powerhouse and h as a bright future.

• Among our re tailers, Ben Bridge (jewelry) and R. C . Willey (hom e furnishi ngs) were  particula r 
standouts last year. 
 
At Ben Bridge sam e-store sal es grew 11.4%, the best  gain among t he publicly-held jewelers whose 
reports I have seen.  Additionally, th e company’s profit marg in widened.  Last year was no t a fl uke: 
During t he past decade , the same-store sale s gains  of the  com pany have a verage d 8.8%. 
 
 Ed an d Jon B ridge a re fourth-generation manage rs and run the business e xactly as if it were t heir own 
– which it is in every res pect excep t for Berkshire’s name on the stock ce rtificates.  The  Bridges h ave 
expa nded successful ly by securing the right locations an d, more im portantly, by staffing these st ores 
with enthusiastic an d kno wledg eable asso ciates.  We will mo ve into Minn eapolis-St. Pau l this year. 
 
At Utah -based R. C. Willey, the gains from expansion have been even more dram atic, with 41.9% of 
2004 sales coming fr om out-of-state stores that didn’t exi st before 1999.  The com pany also im prove d 
its profit margin in 200 4, propelled  by its two n ew stores in Las Veg as. 
 
 I would like to tell you that these sto res were my idea.  In truth, I tho ught they were m istakes.  I knew, 
of course, how b rillian tly Bill  Child had run the R. C. Willey o peration in Utah , where its market share 
had l ong been huge.  B ut I felt our cl osed-on-Sunday policy woul d prove disastrous away from  hom e.  
Even our first out-of-state store in Boise, which was highly successf ul, left me uncon vinced.  I kept 
asking whether Las Ve gas r esidents, conditioned t o seve n-day-a-week retailers, w ould adjust to us. 
Our first Las  Vegas store, ope ned in 2001, answered this question in a re sounding m anner, 
immediately becom ing ou r number one unit. 
 
 Bill and Sc ott Hym as, his successor as CEO, t hen proposed a sec ond Las Ve gas st ore, only about 20 
minutes away .  I fel t this expansion would canni balize the first unit, adding si gnificant cost s but only 
modest sales.  The result? Each  store is now do ing about 26% more volume th an any other store in the 
chain and is con sisten tly showing  large year-o ver-year gains. 
 
 R. C. Willey will soo n open in Reno .  Befo re making this co mmitment, Bill an d Sco tt again asked for 
my ad vice.  Initiall y, I was pretty p uffed up abo ut the fact that they were con sulting me.  But then it 
dawned on me that the opi nion of som eone wh o is always wrong has its o wn special u tility to decisio n-
makers. 
 
 
 14 • Earni ngs improved in flight servi ces.  At FlightSafet y, the world ’s leader in  pilot trainin g, profits ro se 
as cor porate av iation rebound ed and  our business with reg ional air lines in creased .  We now operate 
283 simulators with  an orig inal co st of $1.2 billion.  Pilo ts are train ed one at a time o n this exp ensive 
equipment.  Thi s means t hat as much as $3 .50 of ca pital investment is requ ired to produce $1 o f annual 
revenue.  With th is lev el of capital in tensity, Flig htSafety requi res ve ry high operating margins in order 
to obtain reason able ret urns on capital, wh ich means that utilizat ion rates are all-i mportant.  Last year, 
FlightSafety’s return on tangible equity improve d to 15.1% from 8.4%  in 2003. 
 
In another 2004 event, Al Ueltsch i, wh o foun ded FlightSafety in  1951 with $10,000, turned ov er th e 
CEO po sition  to Bruce Whitman, a 43-year v eteran  at th e company.  (B ut Al’s not going anywhere; I 
won’t let h im.)  Bru ce sh ares Al’s conv iction that flyin g an aircraft is a p rivilege to be exten ded only to 
people who re gularly receive  the highest quality of traini ng and are undenia bly com petent.  A few 
years ag o, Charlie was as ked to intervene with Al on behalf of a tycoon friend whom FlightSafet y had 
flunked.  Al’s reply to Charlie: “Tell yo ur pal he belongs in the back of the plane, not t he cockpit.” 
 
FlightSafety’s num ber o ne customer is NetJets, ou r aircraft fract ional-ownership subsidiary.  Its 2,100 
pilots sp end an average of 18 days a year i n training.  Additionally, th ese p ilots fly on ly one aircraft  
type whe reas many flight operations juggle pilots among seve ral types.  Net Jets’ high st andards on 
both fronts are two of the reasons I signed up with the company years before Berkshire bought it. 
 
 Fully as im portant in my decisions t o both use a nd buy Net Jets, ho weve r, was t he fact  that the 
company was man aged by Rich  Santulli, th e creato r of the fraction al-ownersh ip industry and a fan atic 
about safety and service.  I vi ewed the selection of a flight provider as a kin to picking a brai n surgeon: 
you si mply want the best.  (Let som eone el se experiment with the low bidder.) 
 
 Last year NetJ ets again gaine d about 70% of the net new bu siness (measur ed by dollar value) going to 
the four c ompanies that dominate the ind ustry.  A portion o f our growth cam e from the 25-hour card  
offered by Marquis Jet  Partners.  M arquis is not owned by NetJets, but is instead a customer that 
repackages the purchases it makes from us into smaller packages that it sells th rough its card.  Marqu is 
deals ex clusively with  NetJets, u tilizin g the power of our rep utation  in its mark eting. 
 
 Our U. S. co ntracts, including M arquis cust omers, gre w from 3,87 7 to 4,967 in 2004 ( versus 
approximately 1,200 contracts whe n Berkshire bought NetJets in 1998).  Some clients (incl uding me) 
enter into m ultiple contract s because they wish to use more tha n one type of airc raft, selecting for any 
given trip whicheve r type best fits the mission at  hand. 
 
 NetJets ear ned a m odest  amount in the U.S. last year.  But what we ea rned domestically was l argely 
offset by losses in Europe.  We are  now, however, generating real momentum abroa d.  Contracts 
(including 25-hour cards that we ourselves market in Europe) increase d from 364 to 693 during the 
year.  We will ag ain have a very significant Eu ropean loss in  2005, but domestic earn ings will lik ely 
put us in the black ove rall. 
 
 Europe has been ex pensive for NetJets – fa r more expe nsive than I ant icipated – but it is essent ial to 
building a fligh t operation  that will fo rever be in a class by itself.  Our U.S. owners alread y wan t a 
quality serv ice wh erever they trav el an d their wish  for fligh t hours ab road is certain  to grow 
dram atically in the decades a head.  Last yea r, U.S.  owners made 2,003 flights in E urope, up 22% from 
the pre vious year an d 137% from 2000.  Ju st as im portant, our European owners m ade 1, 067 flights in 
the U.S., up 65% fr om 2003 and 239 % from 2000.

*This is our actual purchase price and al so our tax basis; GAAP “c ost” differs in a few case s 
because of write-ups or write-downs that ha ve bee n require d. 
 
 Some people may look at t his table and view it as  a list of stocks to be bought and s old base d upon 
chart  patterns, brokers’ opinions, or est imates of  near-term earni ngs.  Charlie and I ignore such distractions 
and i nstead view o ur holdings as fract ional owne rships in businesse s.  Thi s is an impo rtant distinction.  
Indeed, this thinking has bee n the cor nerstone of m y investment behavi or since I was 19.  At  that time I 
read Be n Gra ham’s The Intelligent Investo r, and the scale s fell from  my ey es.  (P reviously, I had been 
entranced by the stock market, but didn’t have a cl ue about how to invest.) 
 
 Let’s loo k at ho w the businesses of our “Big  Four” – American  Express, Co ca-Co la, Gillette an d 
Wells Farg o – have fared  since we bo ught into these co mpanies.  As the tab le shows, we in vested $3.83 
billion in the four, by way o f multiple tran sactio ns between May 1 988 and Octob er 2003.  On  a co mposite 
basis, our dollar-weighted purchase dat e is July 1992.  By yearend 2 004, therefore, we had held these 
“business in terests,” on  a wei ghted basis, about 12½ years. 
 
 In 2004, Be rkshire’s share of the group’s earnings am ounte d to $1.2 billion.  T hese earnings  might 
legiti mately be  conside red “norm al.”  True, they were swelled because Gillette and Wells Fargo omitted 
option c osts in their prese ntation of earnings ; but on the ot her ha nd they were re duce d because Coke had a 
non-recurring write-off. 
 
 Our sha re of t he earni ngs of these f our com panies has grown almost every  year, and n ow amounts 
to about 31.3% o f our cost.  Th eir cash  distr ibutions to us have also  grown consisten tly, to taling $434 
million in 2004, or about 11.3% of cost.  All in all, th e Big Fou r have delivered us a satisf actory, tho ugh f ar 
from  spectacular, business  result. 
 
 That’s tru e as well o f our exp erience in  the market with  the group .  Since o ur orig inal purchases, 
valuation gai ns have s omewhat exceede d earni ngs growth  because price/e arnings ratios have inc reased.  On 
a year-to-year basi s, however, the business and m arket performances hav e often diverged, sometimes to an 
extra ordina ry degree.  Duri ng The Great Bubble, market-value gains far outstripped the performance of the 
businesses .  In the afterm ath of the  Bubble, t he reverse was true. 
 16  Clearly, Berkshire’s results would have be en fa r better if I had caugh t this swing  of th e pendulum.  
That m ay see m easy to do when one look s through an always-clean, rear-view mirror.  Unfort unately, 
however, it’s the windshield through which invest ors must peer, a nd that glass is invariably fogged.  Our 
huge positions add to the difficulty of our nimbly danci ng in and out of holdings as valuations s wing. 
 
Nevertheless, I can  prop erly b e criticized  for m erely c lucking about nose-bleed valuation s during  
the Bubble rather t han acting on m y views.  Though I said at the tim e that certain of the stocks we held 
were priced a head of them selves, I undere stimated just  how sev ere the overvaluation  was.  I talk ed when I 
should have  walked. 
 
 What Charlie an d I wou ld like is a lit tle act ion now.  We don’t enj oy sittin g on $43 billion of cash 
equivalents that are earni ng paltry returns.  Instead, we yearn  to buy mo re fraction al interests simila r to 
those we no w own or – better still  – more larg e businesses outright.  We will d o either, however, only wh en 
purchases ca n be m ade at  prices that offer us the prospect of a reasonable return on our investment. 
 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 We’ve re peate dly emphasized that  the “rea lized” gains that we re port quarterly or annually ar e 
meaningless for analytical purposes.   We have a huge amount of unrealized gains on our books, and our 
thinking about when, an d if, to cash  them depends not at all on a desire to repo rt earn ings at one specific  
time or anot her.  A f urther c omplication in our rep orted gains occ urs because G AAP requires that foreign 
excha nge contracts be m arked to m arket, a stipula tion that cau ses unrealized  gains or losses in  these 
holdings to flow through our published earnings as if we had sold our positions.   
 
 Despi te the problems enum erated, y ou may be i nterested in a breakdown of the gains we reported 
in 2003 and  2004.  Th e data r eflect actual sales exce pt in the cas e of cu rrency gains, which are a 
combination of sales and marks to market.

 The junk bond profits in clude a foreign e xchange  com ponent.  When we bought these bonds in 
2001 and 200 2, we fo cused fi rst, of course, on the cred it quality o f the issu ers, all of which were Am erican  
corporations.  Some of t hese com panies, however, had issued bonds denominated in foreign currencies.  
Because of our views on the dolla r, we favored the se for purchase  whe n they were  availa ble. 
 
 As an e xample, we b ought €254 million of  Level  3 bonds (10 ¾% of 2008) in 2001 at  51.7% of  
par, and s old these at 85% of par in December 2004.  T his issue was tra ded in Euro s tha t cost us  88¢ at  the 
time of purchase bu t that brou ght $1.29 when  we sold.  Thus, of our $163 million overall gain, abo ut $85 
million cam e fro m the market’s rev ised opinion about Lev el 3’s cred it quality, with  the rem aining $78 
million resulting from  the a ppreciati on of the Euro.  (In addition, we  received cash interest during our  
holding period that amounted to about 25% annually on our dollar cost.)

Customarily his pu rchases ar e in the $200-$300 million range a nd are i n com panies t hat are sm aller than 
the ones I foc us on.  Ta ke a look at the fa cing page to see wh y Lo u is a cin ch to be inducted into the 
invest ment Hall of Fam e. 
 
 You may be sur prised to learn t hat Lou does not  necessa rily inform  me about what  he is doing.  
When Charlie an d I assign  resp onsibility, we tru ly hand over the baton – and we give it to Lou just as we 
do to our operating managers.  Th erefore, I typically lear n of Lou ’s transaction s about ten  days af ter the 
end of each month.  Sometimes, it should be adde d, I silently disagree with his decisions.  But he’s usuall y right. 
 
Foreign Curr encies 
 
 Berks hire owned about $21.4 billi on of foreign exc hange cont racts at yearend, s pread among 12 
currencies.  As I mentioned last year, hol dings of this kind are a deci ded cha nge for us.  B efore M arch 
2002, neither Berkshire nor I had ever traded in curren cies.  Bu t the evidence grows th at our trade policies  
will p ut unremit ting pressure on  the dollar for m any years to  come – so since 20 02 we’v e heeded that 
warning in setting our investment cour se.  (As W.C. Fields once sai d when asked for a ha ndout: “Sor ry, 
son, all m y money’s tied up  in currency.”)  
 
 Be clear on o ne point: In no way  does our thinking about currencies rest on doubts about America.  
We liv e in an extraordinarily rich  country, the product of a syste m that values m arket econom ics, the rule 
of law a nd equality of opportunity.  Our econom y is far and away th e strongest in the world a nd will 
continue to be.  We are lu cky to live here. 
 
 But as I argue d in a No vember 10, 2003 art icle in Fortune, (avai lable at berkshirehathaway.com), 
our country’s trade practices are we ighing d own the dollar.  Th e declin e in its v alue has alread y been  
substan tial, but is n evertheless lik ely to  continue.  Withou t policy ch anges, curren cy mark ets cou ld even 
become disorderly an d generate sp illover effects, bo th political an d financial.  No  one knows wh ether these 
problems will materialize.  But such a scen ario is a far-from -remote possibility that policymakers sho uld be 
consideri ng now.  Thei r bent, however, is to lean t oward not-so-benign neglect: A 318-page  Congressional 
study of the consequences of un remitting trad e deficits was published in Nov ember 2000 and has been 
gathering  dust ev er sin ce.  The stu dy was o rdered after th e deficit h it a th en-alarm ing $263 billion in 1999; 
by last year it had risen  to $61 8 billion. 
 
 Charlie and  I, it sh ould be emp hasized , believe that true tra de – that is, the excha nge of goods and 
servi ces with other countries – is enormously benefi cial for both us an d them.  Last  year we ha d $1.15 
trillio n of such honest-to-God trad e and  the more of this, th e better.  Bu t, as n oted, o ur cou ntry also 
purchased an ad ditional $6 18 billion in g oods and  serv ices fro m the rest of the world  that was 
unreciprocate d.  That is a staggeri ng figur e and one t hat has  importa nt consequences .  
 
 The balancing item to this one-way p seudo-trad e — in  econ omics th ere is always an  offset — is a  
transfer of wealth  from the U.S. to  the rest of th e world.  Th e tran sfer m ay materialize in the form  of IOUs  
our private o r governmental institutions give to foreign ers, or by way o f their assuming ownership of o ur 
assets, s uch as  stoc ks and real estate.  In e ither case, Am ericans e nd up owni ng a reduced por tion of our 
country wh ile non-Americans own a greate r part.  This force-feedi ng of American  wealth  to the rest of th e 
world  is now p roceeding at th e rate of $1 .8 billion daily, an  increase of 2 0% sin ce I wrote you  last year.  
Consequently, other cou ntries an d their citiz ens now own  a net of about $3 trillio n of the U.S.  A decade 
ago their net ownership was  negl igible. 
 
 The mention of trillio ns numbs most brains.  A furth er source of con fusion is th at th e current 
account deficit (the  sum  of three item s, the m ost im porta nt by fa r being t he trade deficit) a nd our national 
budget deficit  are ofte n lum ped as “twins.”  T hey are any thing but.  They  have different cause s and 
different consequences. 
 
 19  A budget deficit in  no way reduces the por tion of the national pie that goes to  Americans.  As long 
as other countries and their citizens have no net  ownership of the U.S ., 100% of o ur country’s output 
belongs to ou r citizen s under any budget scenario, even one involving a huge defi cit. 
 
 As a rich  “famil y” awash  in goo ds, Am erican s will argu e through their leg islato rs as to  how 
government shoul d redistribute the nat ional output – that is who pay s taxes and who rece ives governmental 
benefits.  If “en titlement” promises fro m an earlie r day have to b e reex amined, “fam ily members” will 
angrily d ebate among themselves as t o who feels t he pain.  Mayb e tax es will g o up; maybe pro mises will 
be modified; mayb e more internal debt will b e issu ed.  Bu t when the figh t is fin ished, all of the fa mily’s 
huge pie remains available for its members, ho wever it is divided.  No slice must be sent  abroad. 
 
 Large a nd persisting curre nt account de ficits produ ce an e ntirely differe nt result.  As time passes, 
and a s claim s against us grow, we own less and less of what we produce.  In eff ect, the rest of the world 
enjoys an  ever-growing royalty o n Am erican  output.  Here, we are lik e a fam ily that co nsisten tly 
overspends its income.  As time p asses, th e fam ily finds that it is w orking more an d more fo r the “finance  
company” and less for itself. 
 
 Should we con tinue to run current acco unt d eficits co mparable to those now prev ailing, the net 
owne rship of the U.S. by other co untries a nd their citizens  a decade fr om now will am ount to roughly $11 
trillio n.  And, if fo reign investors were to  earn  only 5% on that net holding, we would need  to send  a net o f 
$.55 trillio n of go ods and  serv ices ab road every year  merely to  serv ice the U.S. inv estments then held by 
foreigners.  At that date, a decade out, our GDP would probably total about $18 trillion (assum ing low 
inflation, which is far fr om a sure t hing).  Therefore, our U.S . “fam ily” would then be delivering 3% of i ts 
annual ou tput to the rest o f the wo rld simply as tri bute for the overi ndulgences of t he past.  In t his case, 
unlike that involving budget deficits, the son s would truly pay for the sins of th eir fat hers. 
 
 This annual royalty paid the wo rld – which wo uld not disappear unless t he U.S . massively 
underconsumed an d began t o run co nsistent and large trade s urpluses – would undoubtedly produce 
significan t political u nrest in  the U.S.   Americans wou ld still b e living very well, in deed better th an now 
because of the growth i n our econom y.  But they woul d chafe at the ide a of pe rpetually paying tribut e to 
their creditors and owners  abroad.  A cou ntry th at is n ow aspiring to an “Own ership Society” will n ot find 
happiness in – and I’ll use hyperbole here for emphasi s – a “Sha recropper’s Society.”  But that’s precisely 
where our trade po licies, supp orted b y Repu blicans a nd De mocrats alike, are ta king us. 
 
 Many prominent U.S . financial figures , both in and out of g overnment, have st ated that our 
current-account d eficits can not persist.  For  instance, the minutes of the Fed eral Reser ve Open Mar ket 
Committee of Jun e 29-30, 2004 say : “The s taff n oted that outsized ext ernal deficits coul d not be sust ained 
indefinitely.”  But, despite the con stant handwring ing by luminaries, th ey offer no substan tive suggestions 
to tame the burgeoning imbalance. 
 
 In the article I wrote for Fortune 16 months ago, I warned that “a gently decl ining dollar wo uld 
not provide the ans wer.”  And so far it hasn’t.  Yet policymakers c ontinue t o hope for a “s oft landing,” 
mean while cou nseling other countries t o stim ulate (read  “inflate”) t heir econom ies and Americans to s ave 
more.  In my view these admonitions miss the mark:  There are deep-rooted structural p roblems that will  
cause Am erica to continue  to run a huge curre nt-acc ount deficit unless trade  poli cies either c hange 
materiall y or the dollar d eclines by a degree th at cou ld prove unsettlin g to financial m arkets. 
 
 Proponents of the trade st atus quo are f ond of q uoting A dam Smith: “What  is prudence in the 
conduct of eve ry fam ily can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom.  If a fo reign country can s upply us 
with a c ommodity cheape r than we oursel ves ca n make it, b etter bu y it o f them with so me part of the 
produce  of our own industry, employed in a way  in which we have  some adva ntage.” 
 
 I agree.  Note , however, that M r. Smith’s s tatem ent refers  to tra de of product for product, not of 
wealth for product as our cou ntry is d oing to the tune of $.6 trillio n annu ally.  Mo reover, I am  sure that he 
would never have suggest ed that “prudence” consisted of his “fam ily” selling off part of its farm ever y day 
 20 in order to finance its ov erconsu mption.  Yet th at is j ust what th e “great kingdom” called  the Un ited States  
is do ing. 
 
 If the U.S. was ru nning a $.6 trillio n curren t-acco unt surplus, commentators w orldwide wo uld 
violently conde mn our policy, v iewing it as an  extreme form  of “mercantilism ” – a long-discredited  
econ omic strategy  under which countries fostered exports, discouraged imports, and piled up treasure.  I 
would condemn s uch a policy as well.  But, in  effect if not in intent, the rest of th e world  is practicing 
mercan tilism in resp ect to the U.S., an  act made possible by our vast store of assets and  our pristin e credit 
history.  Indeed, the world would never let any other country use a  credit card denominated in its own 
currency to t he insatiable extent we  are e mploying ou rs.  Prese ntly, most foreign investors a re san guine: 
they m ay view us as sp ending junkies, but they know we are rich junkies as well. 
 
 Our spendthrift beha vior won’t, however, be tolerated indefinitely.  And t hough it’s impossi ble to 
forecast just when a nd how t he trade proble m will be resolve d, it’s improbable that the resoluti on will 
foster an increase in the value of our c urrency relative to that of our trading partners.   
 
 We hop e the U.S. adop ts policies th at will  quickly and  substantially  reduce t he current-acc ount 
deficit.  Tru e, a p rompt solution would likely cau se Berk shire to  record  losses on  its forei gn-exchange  
contracts.  But  Berks hire’s re sources  remain heavily con centrated  in dollar-b ased assets, and  both a stro ng 
dollar and  a low-i nflatio n environ ment are very m uch in our in terest.   
 
 If you wis h to keep abreas t of trade and curre ncy m atters, read The Financial Times.  This 
London-based pape r has l ong been t he leading source f or daily international financi al new s and n ow has an 
excellen t American edition.  Both its reportin g and commentary on  trade are first-class. 
 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 And, again, our usual caveat : macro-ec onomics is a tough game in which few pe ople, Charlie and 
I included, have demonstrated skill.  W e may well turn out to be wrong in our currency judgm ents.  
(Indee d, the fact that so m any pundits now predict weak ness fo r the dollar makes us uneasy.)  If so, our 
mistake will  be very  public.  The i rony is that if we chos e the opposite course, leavi ng all of Berk shire’s 
assets in  dollars ev en as th ey declin ed sign ificantly in val ue, no one woul d notice our m istake.  
 
 John May nard Keynes said in his m asterful The Ge neral Theory :  “Worldly wisdom  teaches that it 
is better for re putation t o fail c onventionally than to succeed unconve ntiona lly.” (Or, to put it in less elegant 
terms, lemmings as a cl ass may be deri ded but neve r does an individual lemmin g get criticized .)  Fro m a 
reputational standpoint, Ch arlie an d I run  a clear risk  with our foreign -exchange commitment.  Bu t we 
believe in managing Berkshire as i f we owned 100% of it ourselve s.  And, were  that the case, we would not  
be following  a dollar-on ly policy.

• Last year I t old you about a group of University of Ten nessee fi nance s tudents who played a key 
role in our $1.7 billion acquisition of Clayt on Homes.  Earlier, th ey had been brought to Omaha by 
their professor, Al Auxier – he brings a class eve ry year – to tour Nebraska Furniture Mart and 
Bors heim ’s, eat at Gorat’s and ha ve a Q&A session with me at Ki ewit P laza.  These vi sitors, like  
those who come for our annual meeting, leave i mpressed by  both the city and i ts friendly 
residents. 
 
Other colleges and universities h ave now co me calling.  This scho ol year we will h ave visiting 
classes, ra nging in size from 30 to 100 students, from Chicago , Dartmouth (Tuck), Delaware State, 
Flori da State, India na, Iowa , Iowa State, Mary land, Nebras ka, Nort hwest Nazare ne, Pe nnsylva nia 
(Wharton), Stanford, Tennessee, Texas, Te xas A&M , Toronto (Rotman), Uni on and Utah.  M ost 
of the stud ents are MBA cand idates, an d I’ve been impressed  by their quality.  Th ey are keenly 
interested in business a nd investments, but  their quest ions indicate that they also hav e more on  
their minds t han simply making money .  I always feel good after meeting them. 
 
 21 At ou r sessi ons, I tell th e newcomers th e story of the Tenn essee group  and its spo tting of Clayton 
Homes.  I do  this in the spirit o f the farm er wh o enters his h en house with an ostrich egg and 
admonishes the flo ck: “I do n’t lik e to complain, girls, bu t this is j ust a s mall sample of what the 
competitio n is doing.”  To  date, ou r new sco uts have not brought us deals.  Bu t their missio n in 
life has been made clear to t hem. 
 
• You should be aware of an  acco unting rule that mild ly distorts our financial state ments in a pain-
today , gain-tomorrow  manner.  B erkshire purchases l ife insurance  policies from individuals and 
corporations who would otherwise surrender them for cas h.  As the new holder of the policies, we 
pay any prem iums that beco me due and ul timately – wh en the ori ginal holder dies – collect the 
face value of the policies. 
 
The orig inal po licyh older is u sually in  good health  when we pu rchase the p olicy.  Still, th e price 
we p ay for it is always well ab ove its cash  surrend er value (“CSV”).  Sometimes th e original 
policyho lder has bo rrowed  against the CSV to  make pr emium paym ents.  In that case, t he 
remaining CSV will b e tiny and our purchase p rice will b e a larg e multiple of what the orig inal 
policyholde r woul d have  recei ved, had he  cashed out by surrende ring it. 
 
Unde r account ing rules, we must immediately char ge as a realized capi tal loss the excess over 
CSV th at we pay u pon purchasin g the policy.  W e also must make additional charges each  year fo r 
the am ount by which the premium we pay  to keep the policy in force e xceeds t he increase in CSV.  
But obviously, w e don’t think these bookkeep ing charges r epresent econ omic losses.  I f we did, 
we wouldn’t buy the policies. 
 
During 2004, we rec orded net “losses” fr om the purc hase of policies (and from the prem ium 
payments req uired to maintain them) totaling $207 million, wh ich was ch arged against realized  
invest ment gains in our earnings statement (included in “other”  in the table on page 17).  When 
the procee ds from  these policies are receive d in th e future, we will record as realized inve stment 
gain t he excess over the t hen-CSV. 
 
• Two post-bubble gove rnance reforms have b een pa rticularly useful  at Berkshi re, an d I fa ult myself 
for no t putting th em in place many years a go.  Th e first involves regu lar m eetings of directo rs 
without the C EO present.  I’ve sa t on 19 boards, and on many occasions this process  would have 
led to dub ious plans being examined more th oroughly.  In a few cases, CEO changes that were 
neede d would also have been  made more prom ptly.  There i s no do wnside to this process, an d 
there a re many possible benefits. 
 
The sec ond reform concer ns the “w histleblower line,” an a rrangem ent through which employees 
can send  informatio n to me and the board’s audit committe e witho ut fear o f reprisal.  Berk shire’s 
extrem e decentralization m akes this system  partic ularly va luable both to me and the committee.   
(In a spra wling “ci ty” of 18 0,000 – B erkshire’s cur rent employee cou nt – not every  spar row that 
falls will be noticed at headqua rters.)  Most of the com plaints we have  received are of “the guy 
next t o me has ba d breath” variety, but on occas ion I have learne d of important probl ems at our 
subsidiaries that I ot herwise would have missed.  The issues rai sed are usually not of a t ype 
discoverable by au dit, bu t relate in stead to  personnel and business practices.  B erkshire would be 
more valuable today if I had put in a wh istleblo wer lin e decades ago . 
 
• Charlie and I love the idea of shareholders thinking and behaving like owners.  Sometimes that 
requires th em to be pro-active.  And in this aren a larg e institutional owners shou ld lead  the way. 
 
So far, however, the moves made by  institutions have been less than awe-inspiring.  Usually, 
they’ve focused on minutiae and igno red the three questio ns that tru ly count.  First, d oes the 
company have the right CEO?  Second, is he/she overreac hing in terms of com pensat ion?  Third, 
are proposed acquisition s more lik ely to  create o r destroy per-share value? 
 
 22 On such questions, the interests of t he CEO m ay wel l differ from thos e of the shareholders.  
Director s, moreover, sometimes lack  the knowledge or gumption to ov errule the CEO.  Th erefore, 
it’s v ital th at larg e own ers focus on these three questions a nd speak up when necessa ry. 
 
Instea d many sim ply follow a “chec klist” ap proach to the issu e du jour.  Last year I was on the 
receiving end of a judgm ent reache d in that  manner.  Se veral institutional share holders and their 
advis ors deci ded I lac ked “inde pendence” in my role as  a director of Coca-C ola.  One group 
want ed me rem oved fr om the b oard and anot her si mply want ed m e booted from the au dit 
committee. 
 
My first impulse was  to secre tly fund the group behind the seco nd idea.  Why  anyone would wish 
to be on an audit committee is beyond  me.  But since directors must be assig ned to one commit tee 
or an other, and since no C EO want s me on hi s com pensat ion committee, it’s often bee n my lot to 
get an audit committee assig nment.  As it turned out, the institutions that opposed me failed and I 
was re-elected to the aud it job.  (I fought off the urg e to ask for a recount.) 
 
Some institutions questione d my “indepe ndence” b ecause, among ot her things, McLa ne and Dai ry 
Queen buy lots of Coke products.  ( Do they want us to favor Pepsi?)  Bu t independence is defined 
in Webst er’s as “not subject  to control by others.”   I’m puzzled how anyone could conclude that 
our Coke purchases w ould “control” my deci sion-m aking when the counterweight is the wel l-
being of $8 billion o f Coke stock held by Berkshire.  Assuming I’m even m arginally rational, 
elementary arithm etic should make  it clear that my heart  and m ind belong to the owners of Coke, 
not to its managem ent. 
 
I can ’t resist mentioning that Jesus understood the cal ibration of independence far m ore clearly 
than do the pro testin g institutio ns.  In Matt hew 6:21 He observed: “For wh ere y our treasure is, 
there will yo ur heart b e also .”  Ev en to an institutional investor, $8 billion should qualify as  
“treasure” that dwarfs any profits  Berkshire might earn on its routine transactions with Coke. 
 
Measure d by the biblical sta ndard, the Berkshi re board is  a model: (a ) every director is  a member 
of a fam ily owning at least $4 million o f stock; (b) none of these s hares were ac quire d from 
Berk shire via options or gran ts; (c) no directors receive c ommit tee, co nsulting or board fees from 
the com pany that are m ore than a tiny portion of th eir annu al income; and (d) alth ough we hav e a 
standard corp orate ind emnity arran gement, we carry no liability in surance for directors. 
 
At Berks hire, board m embers travel  the same road as s hareholders. 
 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 
Charlie and I have see n much be havior confirming the Bible’s “t reasure” point.  In our view, 
based on our considerable boardroom expe rience, t he least indepe ndent directors  are likely to be  
those who receive an im portant fra ction of their annual incom e from  the fees  they receive for 
board service (and who hope as wel l to be recom mended for election to other boards and thereby 
to boost th eir income further).  Yet th ese are the very board m embers most ofte n classed as  
“independent.” 
 
Most directors of this type are  decent pe ople and do a first-c lass job.  But they wouldn’t be hum an 
if they weren’t te mpted to thwart action s that wo uld threaten their livelihood.  Some may go on to 
succumb to such  temptations. 
 
Let’s look at an example bas ed upon circumstantial evidence.  I have first-hand knowledge of a 
recent acquisition proposal (not from  Berkshire) t hat was favored by managem ent, blessed by the  
company’s investment banke r and sl ated to go f orward at a price above  the lev el at which the 
stock had sold for som e years ( or now sells for).  In addition, a number of directors favored the 
transact ion and wanted it proposed to shareholders. 
 
 23 Seve ral of t heir brethren, howeve r, each of whom received board and committee fees totaling 
about $10 0,000  annu ally, scu ttled the propo sal, wh ich meant that sh areholders never learn ed of 
this multi-billion offer.  Non-m anagement directors owned little sto ck except for sh ares th ey had 
receive d from  the com pany.  Their open-market purcha ses in rece nt years ha d meanwhile been 
nominal, eve n though the stock had sold far below the acquisition price proposed.  In other words, 
these di rectors didn’t want  the sha reholders to be offe red X eve n though they had consi stently 
declin ed th e opp ortun ity to  buy sto ck for thei r own acc ount at a fracti on of X. 
 
I don’t know which directors opposed l etting shareholders see t he offe r.  But I do k now that 
$100,000 is an important portion of the annual income of som e of those deem ed “i ndependent,” 
clearly meetin g the Matth ew 6:21 definition of “t reasure.”   If the deal ha d gone t hrough, these fees  
would have ended. 
 
Neith er th e shareho lders nor I will ev er kn ow what motivated the dissenters.  Indeed they 
themselves will n ot likely kno w, given that sel f-interest i nevitably blurs in trospection.  We do 
know one thing, though: At the sam e meeting at whic h the deal was reje cted, the board voted itself 
a significant i ncrease in di rectors ’ fees. 
 
• While we are on the sub ject of self-i nterest, let’s tu rn again  to the m ost important acco unting 
mech anism still av ailab le to CEOs who wish to overstate earni ngs: the non-expensing of stock 
options .  The accom plices in perpetuating t his ab surdity have been m any members of Congre ss 
who have defied the arguments put forth by all Big Fo ur auditors, all members o f the Financial 
Acco unting Standa rds Board and virtually all invest ment professi onals. 
 
I’m enclosing an op-e d piece I wrote for The Was hington Post  desc ribing a truly breathtaking bill 
that was passe d 312-111 by the House last sum mer.  Than ks to Senator Richard Shelby, the Senat e 
didn’t ratify th e Ho use’s foo lishn ess.  And , to his great cred it, Bill Do naldson, th e investor-
minded Chairman  of the SEC, h as stood firm against massive political p ressure, generated  by the 
check -waving CEOs who first muscled Congress in 1993 about the issue of option acc ounting and 
then repeated t he tactic last year. 
 
Because t he attempts to obfuscate the st ock-optio n issue continue, it’s worth poi nting out that no 
one – nei ther the FA SB, nor invest ors ge nerally, nor I – are t alking about restricting the use o f 
options i n any way.  Indee d, my successor at Berks hire may well receive m uch of his pay via  
options, albeit logically-stru ctured ones in resp ect to  1) an appropriate strike price, 2) a n escalation 
in price that reflects the retention of earnings, and 3) a ba n on his quickly disposing of any shares 
purchased t hrough options.  We chee r arra ngem ents that motivate managers , whether these be  
cash bonuses or options.  And if a co mpany is tru ly receiv ing value for the options it issu es, we 
see no  reason why recording their cost should cut dow n on their use. 
 
The sim ple fact is th at certain CEOs know their own compensation  would be far more ratio nally 
determined if options were exp ensed.  Th ey also suspect that their stock w ould sell at a l ower price 
if realistic acc ounting were em ployed, meaning that they wou ld reap less in  the market when they 
unloade d their personal holdings.  To these CEOs such unpleasant  prospects are a  fate to be fought 
with all th e reso urces th ey have at hand – even thou gh the funds they use in t hat fight norm ally 
don’t belong to them, but are instead pu t up by th eir sharehold ers. 
 
 Option-expensing is scheduled to become mandatory on June 15th.  You ca n the refore expect 
intensified effo rts to  stall o r emasculate th is rule between n ow and  then.  Let yo ur Con gressm an 
and Sen ators know what you  think on this issu e. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 24 The Annual Meeting  
 
 There  are two cha nges this year concerning the annual meeting.  Fi rst, we have sc heduled the 
meetin g for the last Satu rday in  April (the 30th), rath er th an the usual first Saturd ay in May.  Th is year 
Mother’s Day falls on May 8, and it would be unfair to ask the employees o f Borsheim’s and Gorat’s to 
take care of us at that special time – so we’ve m oved everything up a we ek.  Ne xt year we’ll return  to our 
regular tim ing, holding the meetin g on May 6, 2006. 
 
 Additionally, we are c hanging the sequence of e vents on meeting day , April 30.  Just as al ways, 
the doors will o pen at th e Qwest Cen ter at 7 a.m. and the movie will b e shown at 8:30.  At 9:30, however, 
we will g o directly to the question and answer p eriod, which (allo wing  for lunch at th e Qwest’s stan ds) will  
last u ntil 3:00.  Then, after a sh ort recess, C harlie and  I will convene the ann ual meetin g at 3:15. 
 
 We ha ve m ade this chan ge be cause a n umber of s hareholders com plained last year about  the time 
consumed by  two speakers who advocat ed proposal s of limited interest to the majority of the audience – 
and who  were no doubt relishing their chance to talk  to a cap tive group of about 19,500.  With our n ew 
procedure, those sha reholders who wish to hear it all can stick around for the formal meeting and those who 
don’t can leav e – or better yet shop. 
 
 There w ill be plenty of opportun ity fo r that pastime in the vast ex hibition hall that adj oins the 
meeting area.  Kelly Muchem ore, the Fl o Zi egfel d of B erkshire, put  on a magnificent shopping 
extra vaganza last year, and s he says that was just a wa rm-up for this y ear.  (Kelly , I am delighted to report, 
is getting m arried in October.  I’m  giving her away  and s uggested that she make a li ttle history by holding 
the we dding at the annual m eeting.  She balked, however, wh en Charlie insisted that he be  the ringbea rer.) 
 
 Again we will showcase a 2,1 00 square foot Cl ayton home (featu ring Ac me brick, Shaw carpet, 
Johns Manville insulation, MiTek fast eners, Carefree a wnings a nd NFM furniture).  Take a t our through 
the home.  Better yet, buy it. 
 
 GEIC O will h ave a boo th staffed  by a nu mber of its to p counselors from around the coun try, all of 
them read y to supply you  with auto insuran ce quotes.  In m ost cases, GEICO will b e able to give yo u a 
special shareholder discount (us ually 8%).  This sp ecial offer is perm itted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in 
which we o perate.  B ring the details of y our existing insurance a nd check out whet her we can sa ve you 
money . 
 
 On Saturd ay, at the Omaha airpo rt, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets® 
availab le for your insp ection .  Stop  by the NetJets boo th at the Qwest t o learn a bout view ing these planes.  
Come to Omaha by bus; leav e in your  new plane. 
 
 The B ookworm shop did a terrific business last year sel ling B erkshire-related books.  Di splaying 
18 titles, th ey so ld 2,920 copies fo r $61,000.  Sin ce we ch arge the shop no rent (I m ust be getting soft), it 
gives shareho lders a 20 % discount.  Th is year I’ve asked  The Boo kworm to add Grah am Alliso n’s Nuclear  
Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe , a m ust-rea d for those concer ned with the safet y of our 
country.  In  addition, the shop  will p remiere Poor C harlie’s Almanack,  a book compiled by Peter Kaufman.  
Scholars ha ve fo r too long debated whether Charlie is the rein carnation of Ben  Frank lin.  This book shou ld 
settle th e question. 
 
 An attachm ent to t he proxy  material that is encl osed w ith th is report explains how you  can obtain 
the cred ential yo u will n eed for ad mission to the meeting and other events.  As fo r plane, ho tel and car 
reser vations, we have a gain signed up American Ex press (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  The y do 
a terrific job for us eac h year, and I tha nk the m for it. 
 
 At Ne braska  Furniture  Mart, located on a 77-ac re site on 72nd Street between Dodge  and Pacific, 
we will again be having “Berk shire Week end” pricing .  We in itiated  this special ev ent at NFM ei ght years 
ago, and sal es during the “Weeke nd” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $25.1 million in 2004 (up 45% 
 25 from  a year earlier).  Every year has set a new record, and on Saturday of last year, we had t he largest  
single-day sales in NFM ’s history – $6 .1 million. 
 
 To get the discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, April 28 and Monday, 
May 2  inclusive, an d also  present your m eeting cred ential.  Th e period’s sp ecial p ricing  will ev en apply to 
the products of several  prestigious m anufact urers that normally have i ronclad rules aga inst discounting but 
that, in the spirit of our shareholder week end, have  made an exce ption for y ou.  We a ppreciate their 
cooperation.  NFM  is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m . Monday through S aturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p. m. on 
Sunday .  On Saturday this year, f rom 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we are having a special affair for s hareholders  
only.  I’ll be there, eat ing barbeque and drinking Coke. 
 
 Borsheim’s – the larg est jewelry sto re in the country ex cept for Tiffan y’s Manh attan  store – will 
have t wo sha reholder-only events.  The first  will be a cocktail reception from  6 p.m . to 10 p.m. on Fri day, 
April 2 9.  The seco nd, the main  gala, will b e from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday, May 1 .  On Saturday, we 
will b e open until 6 p.m.   
 
 We w ill have h uge crow ds at Bo rsheim’s th roughout the weekend.  Fo r your con venience, 
therefore, sh areholder prices will b e available fro m Monday, April 25  throug h Saturday, May 7 .  During 
that period, just identify yoursel f as a s hareholder through your m eeting c redentials or a brokerage 
statement.   
 
 Borsheim’s operates on a gross m argin th at is fu lly twenty p ercentage points below t hat of its 
major rivals, even before the share holders’ discount.  Last year, busines s over the weekend inc reased 73% 
from 2003, settin g a reco rd that will b e tough to beat.  Show m e it can  be done. 
 
 In a ten t outside of Borsheim’s, Patrick  Wolff, twice U.S. ch ess ch ampion, will tak e on all co mers 
in groups of six – blindfolded.  Add itionally, we will h ave Bob  Hamm an and Sh aron Osberg, two of th e 
world’s top bridge e xperts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon.  They  plan to keep 
their eyes open – but Bob never sorts his cards, eve n when playing for a national champions hip. 
 
 Gorat’s – my fav orite steak house – will again  be open exclu sively for Berk shire sh areholders on 
Sunday, May 1, and  will b e serv ing from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please re member that to come to Gorat’s o n 
that day, you  must have a reservation .  To make one, call 40 2-551-3733 on  April 1 ( but not before).  If 
Sunday is so ld out, try Gorat’s o n one of th e other evenings yo u will b e in town.  Enh ance you r reputation 
as an  epicure by ordering, as I do, a rare T-bone with a double helping of hash browns. 
 
 We will again have a special r eception from 4:00 to 5: 30 on Saturd ay afternoon for sha reholde rs 
who have come from outside of North America.  E very year our meeting dra ws many people from around 
the globe, and Charlie and I want  to be sure we pe rsonally greet  those who have come so fa r.  Last  year we 
enjoyed m eeting more than 400 of you including at least 100 from Australia.  Any shareholder who comes 
from other than the U.S. or Canada will be g iven a special cred ential an d instructions for atten ding this 
function.

 Charlie and  I are lu cky.  We have jobs th at we love an d are hel ped every day in a myriad of ways 
by talen ted and cheerfu l associates.  No  won der we tap-d ance to  work.  But nothing is more fun  for us th an 
getting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire’s annual meeting.  So join us on April 30th at the  
Qwest for our annual W oodstock for Capitalists.
