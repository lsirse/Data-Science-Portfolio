# Calculate the amount of stop words

Calculate how many stop words are in the input dataset. Stop words list is in 
‘/datasets/stop_words_en.txt’ file. I will use the Hadoop counter to count the
number of stop words and total words in the dataset.The result is the percentage of stop
words in the entire dataset (without percent symbol).
