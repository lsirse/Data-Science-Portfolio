# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

_Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only._

## Content

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/boston_housing): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	
	- [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/finding_donors): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.

	- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/customer_segments): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas_


- ### Deep Learning

	- [Deep Learning: Algorithm for a Dog Identification App](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/dog-project): Dog breed classifier app which uses Deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to classify dog breeds. To reduce training time without sacrificing accuracy, CNNs were trained with GPU using transfer learning.

- ### Reinforcement learning


	- [Deep Q-Learning: Train a Quadcopter How to Fly](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/quadcopter-project): Training an agent (Quadcopter) how to fly using Deep Q-Learning. The project is a replication of the DeepMind paper: [Lillicrap, Timothy P., et al., 2015. Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf). The project includes Actor-Critic method, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise and Replay buffer. 

	_Tools: scikit-learn, keras, numpy, pandas_

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

	- [Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Titanic%20Survival%20Exploration): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.

	_Tools: numpy, pandas, seaborn_

	

- ### Micro Projects: 

	- __HIVE Data Definition Language (DDL)__
		- [Comparison of Popularity of Stackoverflow Tags](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Micro%20Projects/Stackoverflow_tag_popularity-Hive%20DDL): Comparison of popularity of Stackoverflow tags in 2009 and 2016 using Apache Hiveâ„¢ Data Definition Language (DDL).

	- __Decision Trees__
		- [Titanic Survival Exploration with Decision Trees](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Micro%20Projects/titanic_decisiontrees.ipynb): Training and testing Decision Trees model in order to predict survival of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic.

	- __Naive Bayes Algorithm__
		- [Detecting Spam SMS messages using Naive Bayes](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Micro%20Projects/naive-bayes): Using Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model.


	- __K-Means__
		- [K-means clustering of movie ratings](): 

	_Tools: Hive DDL, scikit-learn_
