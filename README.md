## Content

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/boston_housing): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	
	- [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/finding_donors): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms (SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.

	- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/customer_segments): Analyzing a dataset (using PCA, Gaussian Mixture Model) containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn_


- ### Deep Learning

	- [Deep Learning: Algorithm for a Dog Identification App](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/dog-project): Dog breed classifier app which uses Deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to classify dog breeds. To reduce training time without sacrificing accuracy, CNNs were trained with GPU using transfer learning.

	_Tools: keras, numpy, matplotlib_

- ### Reinforcement learning


	- [Deep Q-Learning: Train a Quadcopter How to Fly](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/quadcopter-project): Training an agent (Quadcopter) how to fly using Deep Q-Learning. The project is a replication of the DeepMind paper: [Lillicrap, Timothy P., et al., 2015. Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf). The project uses Actor-Critic method, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise and Replay buffer. 

	_Tools: keras, numpy, pandas_

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

	- [Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Titanic%20Survival%20Exploration): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.

	_Tools: numpy, pandas, seaborn_


- ### Micro Projects: 

	- __Decision Trees__
		- [Titanic Survival Exploration with Decision Trees](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Micro%20Projects/titanic_decisiontrees.ipynb): Training and testing Decision Trees model in order to predict survival of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic.

	- __Naive Bayes Algorithm__
		- [Detecting Spam SMS messages using Naive Bayes](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Micro%20Projects/naive-bayes/Bayesian_Inference.ipynb): Using Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model.

	- __K-Means__
		- [K-means Clustering of Movie Ratings](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Micro%20Projects/movie-ratings/k-means%20Clustering%20of%20Movie%20Ratings.ipynb): Using k-means clustering algorithm in order to produce movie recommendations.

	- __Principal component analysis (PCA), Support vector machines (SVM)__
		- [Faces recognition using eigenfaces and SVMs](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Micro%20Projects/PCA.ipynb): Application of principal component analysis for face recognition.

	- __Keras__

		- [Analyzing IMDB Data in Keras](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Micro%20Projects/IMDB_In_Keras.ipynb): Training and testing Sequential Keras model with IMDB movie data.

	- __Independent Component Analysis (ICA)__
		- [Retrieving original signal with ICA](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Micro%20Projects/ICA/Independent%20Component%20Analysis.ipynb): Using Independent Component Analysis to retrieve original signals from three observations each of which contains a different mix of the original signals.

	_Tools: Hive, scikit-learn_

- ### Big Data Micro Projects
	- __HIVE Data Definition Language (DDL)__
		- [Comparison of Popularity of Stackoverflow Tags](https://github.com/lsirse/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Micro%20Projects/Stackoverflow_tag_popularity-Hive%20DDL): Comparison of popularity of Stackoverflow tags in 2009 and 2016 using Apache Hiveâ„¢ Data Definition Language (DDL).

	_Tools: Hive_
