# Data Analysis and Visualisation
## Project: Titanic Survival Exploration
### Project Overview

In 1912, the ship RMS Titanic struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank, resulting in the deaths
of most of its passengers and crew. In this project, using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations we will explore a
subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived
or did not survive.


### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Code

The code is provided in the `titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb` notebook file. `visuals.py` contains supplementary functions for data visualisation and the data is in the `titanic_data.csv` file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the the project's directory `Titanic Survival Exploration/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
