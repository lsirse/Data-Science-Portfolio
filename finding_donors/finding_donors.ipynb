    "In this project, we will employ several supervised algorithms of our choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. We will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Our goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as will be seen) infer this value from other publicly available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The dataset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. The article by Ron Kohavi can be found [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. "

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully."

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, let's assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. "

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Let's list three of the supervised learning models above that are appropriate for this problem that you we will test on the census data. For each model chosen, let's discuss it's applications in industry, strengths, weaknesses, appropriateness of the model."
   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "First suitable model is Support Vector Machines (SVM):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classification of patients into sick and healthy according to numerous medical test results.\n",
    "- Strengths of the model: effective in high dimensional spaces, still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples, memory efficient - uses a subset of training points in the decision function. Versatile - custom kernels.\n",
    "- Weaknesses of the model: Overfitting possibility if the number of features is much greater than the number of samples. Do not directly provide probability estimates, expensive five-fold cross-validation necessary.\n",
    "- The model is appropriate for this problem, since there is a large number of features with moderate dataset of 45222 of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second suitable model is Decision trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A good real-world application in industry is any classification problem if there are enough samples and features: predicting if a student will enter university, predicting if the loan will default, etc.\n",
    "- Strengths of the model: simple to understand and interpret. Trees can be visualized. Requires little data preparation: often only normalisation and dummy variables are necessary. The cost of the three is only O(log n). Able to handle both numerical and categorical data, multi-output problems. White-box model - easily interpretable. Possible to validate a model using statistical tests.\n",
    "- Weaknesses of the model: Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well - overfits the data. Decision trees can be unstable due to small variations in the data which might result in a completely different tre being generated (can be mitigated by using Decision Trees with ensemble). Problem of learning an optimal decision tre is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Decision tree learners can create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree. \n",
    " - This model is a good candidate for the problem, since it is labeled, has many features and has enough samples. Besides, decision trees allow to interpret them, leading to the possibility of choosing the most relevant features. Besides, the number of samples is not too large and it won't take too much time in order to find the optimal decision tree.\n",
    " \n",
    "Finally, the third suitable model is ensemble methods (Bagging, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting). Among them we will choose Random Forest method in order to see how well it optimizes the Decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real world applications include datasets with a lot of features and very large number of samples with the need to get well performing model in terms of precision,recall or accuracy. For instance, targeting advertisements for user of social media, search engine according to his profile. Classifying companies into good prospects or bad prospects. Predicting future direction of a macroeconomic variable (for instance, GDP growth)  using many different factors.\n",
    "- The strength of the ensemble methods is that it can handle big amount of samples and a big amount of features. Besides, they are fast and memory efficient, since they use only part of the data in order to make predictions. Ensemble methods are meta-algorithms which combine several machine learning techniques into one predictive model in order to decrease variance (bagging), bias (boosting), or improve predictions (stacking).\n",
    "- The weakness of the ensemble methods is that they are black-boxes. Their results cannot be interpreted. Another classical weakness is the likelihood of overfitting.\n",
    "- This makes a good candidate, since we can find an optimal solution using ensemble methods. Although the sample is not very large, it is large enough to be used in such kind of method. Besides, it is labelled and has high amount of features. \n",

    "The goal of ensemble methods is to combine the predictions of several base estimators with a given learning algorithm (in this case, decision trees) in order to improve generalizability / robustness over a single estimator. The random forests ensemble method is in the family called averaging method. It builds several estimators independently and averages the predictions. The combined estimator is usually better than any of the single base estimator because its variance is reduced. \n",
    "To be more specific, in random forests algorithm, each tree in the ensemble is built from a sample drawn with replacement from the training set. In addition, when splitting node during the construction of the tree, the split that is chosen is no longer the best split among all features. Instead, the split that is picked is the best split among a random subset of the features. As a result of this randomness, the bias of the forest usually slightly increases, but, due to averaging, its variance also decreases, usually more than compensating for the increase in bias, hence yielding an overall better model.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model we found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
